# Experiment using Joystick module (hardware) and LEDs with Arduino Nano


## Abstract
This small experiment's purpose is to learn how to use an Arduino to take analog input from a joystick and trigger some kind of response with respect to the signals received.<br>
In this experiment, the triggered responses are simulated using LEDs by turning them on and off in response to the movement of the joystick and button press<br>
Later on, this knowledge and experience can be applied in the making of a wired/wireless controller for another machine.


## Hardware
1. Arduino Nano
2. HW-504 joystick module
3. LEDs
4. Jumperwires
5. Breadboard<br>
(Optional)
6. 18650 Li-ion battery 3.7V
7. 18650 battery holder 1s
